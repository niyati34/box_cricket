php install_phpmailer.php
```

**Option 3: Download manually**

- Download PHPMailer files to `lib/` directory
- Create `lib/autoload.php` for autoloading

### Email Configuration

The system uses PHPMailer with SMTP. Update `lib/Mailer.php` with your SMTP settings:

- Host: Your SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
- Port: SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
- Authentication: Username/password if required

Notes:

- Database changes: `bookings.qr_token` (unique) and `bookings.checked_in_at` were added. Run migrations if you already have a DB.
- QR codes are generated via Google Chart API for simplicity.
